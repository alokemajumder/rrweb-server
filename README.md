# rrweb-server
A simple server for capturing rrweb sessions with enhanced plugins . It allows website owners to simply add a hosted recorder script (served via jsDelivr) to their site and start capturing user sessions.   The backend validates each session using a pre-shared domain token and routes session data to the correct AWS S3 bucket.
